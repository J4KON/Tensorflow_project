Accurate short-range runoff forecasts are essential for flood warning and water-resources management. The NOAA National Water Model (NWM) provides 1â€“18 h lead-time streamflow forecasts, but these often exhibit systematic underprediction and diminished variance at longer leads. In this project, I developed a deep-learning post-processor that learns the residual errors between NWM forecasts and USGS observations to produce corrected runoff forecasts with reduced bias and improved skill.
